## üíæ Phase 1 Data Collection:
In this phase, I wanted to scrape Goodreads using Selenium and BeautifulSoup. However, I couldn't find a structure for the site or proper filters to extract the data, so I came up with the idea of using the ISBN, which is unique to each book, to obtain the book information. To do that, I needed to collect the ISBNs for Arabic books, so I decided to scrape both Neelwfrat and Diwan bookstores to gather all the ISBNs for the Arabic books. Once I collected the ISBNs, I was able to scrape the books from Goodreads using Selenium to automate the search for each ISBN and obtain the book information.


## üë®‚Äçüíª Phase 2 Data Cleaning:
In this phase, I started with over 30,000 book titles. However, after the initial cleaning process, I ended up with 12,708 book titles that I had scraped from Goodreads. I removed duplicates and conducted further cleaning, which resulted in a final count of 10,500+ book titles that I used in my data analysis.


## üìä Data Analysis and Visualization:
In this phase, I used Plotly to visualize a group of questions that I had selected to be answered with the data.
