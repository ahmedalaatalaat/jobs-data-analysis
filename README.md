## 💾 Phase 1 Data Collection:
In this phase, I plan to collect data from the most famous job sites in Egypt. I discovered that both Wuzzuf and Bayt are large sites from which I can scrape all available jobs.


## 👨‍💻 Phase 2 Data Cleaning:
In this phase, I attempted to clean the data as thoroughly as possible, including completing data from job requirements and descriptions, which was one of the most challenging cleaning tasks I have tackled. I used natural language processing to extract data from the text and complete the rows, doing everything necessary to make the data as clean as possible.


## 📊 Data Analysis and Visualization:
In this phase, I used Plotly to visualize a group of questions that I had selected to be answered with the data.
